            <p>"Getting my hair done by Brihanna Torres (Styledbybrii) has been one of the best experiences Iâ€™ve ever had in regards of friendliness and professionalism. As I got to her home based work place she had all the materials required and made sure to be as kind as possible throughout the long braiding process so I wouldnâ€™t feel uncomfortable or unsatisfied. I really enjoyed my laid back cornrows and made sure to become a reoccurring customer to support her small business which deserves to be much bigger. She is truly a hidden gem and I recommend her to all who plan to get their hair done and have a good time!"</p>
