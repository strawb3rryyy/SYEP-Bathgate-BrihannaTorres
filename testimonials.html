She makes appointments fun no matter what and with all this she still shows her passion and professionalism time and time again! I’m forever grateful I’ve found a hair stylist who is caring and talented at the same time. Once you go you’ll never turn back!"</p>

            <p>"Getting my hair done by Brihanna Torres (Styledbybrii) has been one of the best experiences I’ve ever had in regards of friendliness and professionalism. As I got to her home based work place she had all the materials required and made sure to be as kind as possible throughout the long braiding process so I wouldn’t feel uncomfortable or unsatisfied. I really enjoyed my laid back cornrows and made sure to become a reoccurring customer to support her small business which deserves to be much bigger. She is truly a hidden gem and I recommend her to all who plan to get their hair done and have a good time!"</p>
